 Preface by Ben StraubThe first edition of this book is what got me hooked on Git. This was my intro-
duction to a style of making 
so‡ware that felt more natural than anything I had
seen before. I had been a developer for several years by then, but this was the
right turn that sent me down a much more interesting path than the one I was
on.Now, years later, I†m a contributor to a major Git implementation, I†ve
worked for the largest Git hosting company, and I†ve traveled the world teach-
ing people about Git. When Scott asked if I†d be interested in working on the
second edition, I didn†t even have to think.
It†s been a great pleasure and privilege to work on this book. I hope it helps
you as much as it did me.
vDedicationsTo my wife, Becky, without whom this adventure never would have begun. • Ben
This edition is dedicated to my girls. To my wife Jessica who has supported me
for all of these years and to my daughter Josephine, who will support me when
I†m too old to know what†s going on. • Scott
